There is a higher success rate in campaigns with a lower fundraising goal as opposed to campaigns that have a higher fundraising goal. This makes sense as donators would see that a campaign has a modest goal and would think to themselves “Yes, I think I could contribute to this campaign.” Whereas, if a campaign had a larger goal, an average person might feel that a small contribution from them would not make much of a difference to the overall campaign. Another thing to consider is that a donator might not want to contribute to a campaign unless they feel some sort of strong attachment to the subject matter.   
It would be hard to determine if the month that a campaign is launched plays a role in its success rate. The “Outcomes Based on Launch Dates” graph indicates that 111 campaigns that were launched in May were successful. However, May is also the month with the most failed campaigns. Why does May have the highest number of successful and failed campaigns? This is not a question that can be answered with the information that we have filtered through alone. We would need to look at external factors, such as if anything politically or socially were happening at the time that may or may not have influenced people to donate or pledge to these campaigns. In addition, this graph does not tell us how long each campaign lasted. Does the length that a campaign runs for affect its chances of success or failure?
There were a handful of canceled campaigns in the dataset as well. The “Outcomes Based on Goals” graph showed that a small percentage of campaigns were canceled. One would assume that a campaign with a lower fundraising goal would be more likely to succeed. Our dataset does not dive into why certain campaigns were canceled; however these cancellations might be able to shed light on what factors that could contribute to the success of failure of a campaign.
